<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
<p>This notebook analyzes a single database containing information about symptoms related to diabetes. This is a public database sourced from the internet and its data or insights does not represent official medical results that can be used in real-life studies.  However, the following hypotheses and processes are carefully planned and coded to offer a high-quality data science example work.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The purpose of this data science project is to develop an algorithm capable of predicting the presence of diabetes in new patients based on their medical tests and personal symptoms.</p>
<p>We also aim to uncover additional insights throughout the project that could be valuable to the medical field.</p>
